# ANLP_Final_Project_TaCL_BERT
This repository contains files and materials for the following tasks:

1. Fine-tuning the TaCL-BERT model on the SQuAD dataset, with the goal of improving its performance on context understanding, information extraction, disambiguation, and specificity.

To run the model use the intructions in [Tacl_Fine_Tune_Squad](https://github.com/sandeep-varma8029/ANLP_Final_Project_TaCL_BERT/tree/master/Tacl_Fine_Tune_Squad)
  
2. Conducting a qualitative analysis by sampling a sentence from Wikipedia and visualizing the self-similarity matrix produced by BERT-base and TaCL-base. This comparison helps to further understand the differences in the token representations captured by the two models.


To run the analysis follow the instructions in [Evaluation_and_Analysis](https://github.com/sandeep-varma8029/ANLP_Final_Project_TaCL_BERT/tree/master/Evaluation_and_Analysis)
